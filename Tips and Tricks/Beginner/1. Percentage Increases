In this tutorial I will tell you how to make Percentage Increases which allow small increments to a stat.

First multiply x (your stat that you want to increment) by 100 
then you set a stat called temp to 100
next you will add your percent to temp, you may increment by a stat or a set number
then you divide x by temp, and set temp to 0

If you have x as 100 and y as 101 you will get an output of x = 101
